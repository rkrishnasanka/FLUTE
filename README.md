# FLUTE Router

This repository encapsulates the FLUTE router available in C and wraps it in a SWIG interface for cross platform deployment. The flute-3.1 folder consists of a CMake file which was built by the OpenRoad project. The CMake integration with swig is not yet integrated however, we have a short makefile with the manual compilation instructions (tested on Ubuntu) in `swig` folder.
